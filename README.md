# Sales-Report-Automation-from-SAP-with-Python-and-Excel
Simulated project to automate the extraction, cleaning and visualization of sales data generated by a SAP SD system. The objective was to reduce the time of reporting, minimize human errors and facilitate decision-making using accessible tools.

## Project objective:
Apply continuous improvement principles (Kaizen) to a reporting process, simulating a real SAP
environment, with functional and scalable results.
⸻
## Project stages:
1. Data extraction
• Historical sales data exported from SAP (Excel) was simulated
• Structure with customers, products, orders, quantities and prices
2. Data transformation
• Cleaning with Python using the pandas library
• Format correction, total calculation and error detection
3. Visualization in Excel
• Creation of a dashboard with monthly sales graphs, by customer and product
• Automatic link with the Python script to update data
4. Results:
•
Estimated 80% reduction in reporting time•
Reusable template for other similar processes
